\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion one can say that this experiment has roughly confirmed the expectations. The characteristical times for the optical pumping and the relaxation are in the milliseconds range which are reasonable values. In the second part the aim was to compare the theoretical g-factors which can be calculated to the measured g-factors from the experiment. The experimental values differ quite a bit from the theoretical values, but cannot be a statistical error, because al the values for different magnetic fields are quite the same. One possible explanation was given, as the calculation of the magnetic field does not match the real magnetic field in the gas.
