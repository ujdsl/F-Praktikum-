\section{Target}
In our experiment concerning optical pumping, we want to evaluate the different energy states and its details of Rubidium. We want to show, how they can be changed into another and especially, how the magnetic moments of gas atoms can be aligned in the same direction. This is useful for different, for example medical and physical uses. In the first part we measure the time it needs to polarize al gas atoms in the same direction, while we evaluate the splitting energy of Zeeman-states in the second part.
